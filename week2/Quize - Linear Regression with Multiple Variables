Linear Regression with Multiple Variables

Suppose m=4 students have taken some class, and the class had a midterm exam and a final exam. You have collected a dataset of their scores on the two exams, which is as follows:

midterm exam	(midterm exam)^2	final exam
89	7921	96
72	5184	74
94	8836	87
69	4761	78
You'd like to use polynomial regression to predict a student's final exam score from their midterm exam score. Concretely, suppose you want to fit a model of the form hθ(x)=θ0+θ1x1+θ2x2, where x1 is the midterm score and x_2 is (midterm score)^2. Further, you plan to use both feature scaling (dividing by the "max-min", or range, of a feature) and mean normalization.

What is the normalized feature x(4)2? (Hint: midterm = 69, final = 78 is training example 4.) Please round off your answer to two decimal places and enter in the text box below.


Ans: x(4)2→4761.

Nomalized feature →x−us where u is average of X and s=max−min=8836−4761=4075.

Finally, 4761−6675.54075=−0.47
